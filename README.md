## The Problem with YouTube

YouTube has a built in "shuffle" feature already. **The problem is, it doesn't work.**

Not only will videos repeat multiple times, but some videos never get played at all.

This site will play every video in the playlist once before randomizing the order again.

### Problems with YouTube's API

YouTube has a built in API that lets you get all sorts of information. This includes a list of videos in a given playlist.

However, complications quickly arose when working with this. The API requires a key, which has a limited number of daily uses.

In most cases, this is never a problem. It shouldn't be a problem in this case, either. But every request made to the API resulted
in authorization failure.

## How it works
