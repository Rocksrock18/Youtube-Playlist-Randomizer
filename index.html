      <p>Using YouTube's API requires an API key, which has a limited number of daily uses. An overload of requests leads to
        authorization failure, meaning you wouldn't be able to view anything at all. Usually this isn't a problem, but recently I started
        getting an authorization failure on every request.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, there is a workaround: we can web scrape the playlist source page to find the videos in the playlist.
        This works great, but only the first 100 videos of the playlist are actually loaded in to the page source.
        In other words, we can only retrieve the first 100 videos of a given playlist.
      </p>
      <p>This, too, has a workaround: since we can only get 100 videos at a time, we can split the playlist into 100 video
        chunks and append them. Youtube doesn't currently have a built in way to split playlists, but copying a playlist into a new
        one and deleting the first 100 videos will do the trick. This is of course tedious, but only needs to be done once.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>Why does it tell me there are no videos in the playlist?</p>
      <p>It's likely that you entered an invalid playlist id; copy paste the id from your playlist page and try again. Also, keep in 
        mind that playlists set to private are not accessible. Only public or unlisted playlists can be played.</p>
      <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
      <p>It keeps telling me the server connection failed. How do I fix this?</p>
      <p>If the server is down, the only thing you can do is wait, unfortunately. This will also happen if you run this site
        from anywhere other than rocksrock18.github.io, due to CORS.</p>
      <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
      <p>I want to skip to a certain video in the playlist. How can I do this?</p>
      <p>Click on the song you want to skip to in the video list. This will automatically skip to that place in the
        playlist, regardless of where you were previously.</p>
      <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
      <p>How can I search for a specefic video?</p>
      <p>CTRL+F (or equivalent). Then enter the title of the video you want.</p>
      <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
      <p>What happens when the playlist ends?</p>
      <p>The website will automatically reshuffle the current playlist and start from the beginning. If you want to
        play a new playlist, you'll have to enter the new id and hit "Randomize".</p>
