      <p>Playlists that are set to private are not accessible. Only public or unlisted playlists can be played.</p>
      <p>Using YouTube's API requires an API key, which has a limited number of daily uses. An overload of requests would lead to
        authorization failure, meaning you wouldn't be able to view anything at all. Usually this isn't a problem, but recently I started
        getting an authorization failure on every request.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, there is a workaround: we can web scrape the playlist source page to find the videos in the playlist.
        This works great, but only the first 100 videos of the playlist are actually loaded in to the page source.
        In other words, we can only retrieve the first 100 videos of a given playlist.
