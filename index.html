      <p>Only the first 100 videos of a given playlist will be generated. This means if you want to shuffle a playlist with more,
        you'll need to split the playlist into 100 video chunks and append them. Youtube doesn't currently have a built in way to 
        split playlists, but copying a playlist into a new one and deleting the first 100 videos will do the trick. 
        This is of course tedious, but only needs to be done once.

      <div class="FAQPanel">
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>What is a playlist ID? How can I find it?</p>
        <p>Youtube gives every playlist a unique ID upon creation. To find it, navigate to the youtube page of your playlist. 
          At the end of the url, you should see "list=[playlistID]". <label class="ExampleLabel" onclick="Example()">Show me an example</label></p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>Why does it tell me there are no videos in the playlist?</p>
        <p>It's likely that you entered an invalid playlist id; copy paste the id from your playlist page and try again. Also, keep in 
          mind that certain playlists are not accessible. YouTube auto-generated playlists and private playlists cannot be played.</p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>It keeps telling me the server connection failed. How do I fix this?</p>
        <p>Most often, this happens when the playlist has a private video in it. Private videos cannot be accessed, so the request will get blocked and the connection will fail.
          The easiest fix is to simply copy the playlist into a fresh one and delete the private videos.</p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>I want to skip to a certain video in the playlist. How can I do this?</p>
        <p>Find which video you want to skip to in the video list, and click on it.</p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>How can I search for a specific video?</p>
        <p>CTRL+F (or equivalent). Then enter the title of the video you want.</p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>What if I mix playlists with duplicate videos?</p>
        <p>All duplicate videos are filtered out by default.</p>
        <hr class="SubtleHR"></hr>
        <p>What happens when the playlist ends?</p>
        <p>The website will automatically reshuffle the current playlist and start from the beginning. If you want to
          play a new playlist, you'll have to enter the new id and hit "Randomize".</p>
